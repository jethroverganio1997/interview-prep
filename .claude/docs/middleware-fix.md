# Middleware Fix - Landing Page Access

## Issue Identified
The hero section was "missing" because the landing page (`/`) was being redirected to `/auth/login` by the middleware. The authentication middleware was blocking all unauthenticated users from accessing any route except those starting with `/login` or `/auth`.

## Root Cause
In `lib/middleware.ts`, the authentication check was too restrictive:

```typescript
// OLD CODE (BLOCKING ALL ROUTES)
if (
  !user &&
  !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/login') &&
  !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/auth')
) {
  // Redirect to login
  const url = request.nextUrl.clone()
  url.pathname = '/auth/login'
  return NextResponse.redirect(url)
}
```

This logic meant:
- ❌ Root path `/` → Redirect to login
- ✅ `/auth/*` → Allow access
- ❌ Any other path → Redirect to login

## Solution Applied
Updated the middleware to explicitly allow public routes (marketing pages):

```typescript
// NEW CODE (ALLOWING PUBLIC ROUTES)
// Allow access to marketing pages (landing page) without authentication
const isPublicRoute =
  request.nextUrl.pathname === '/' ||
  request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/auth')

if (!user && !isPublicRoute) {
  // no user, redirect to login page
  const url = request.nextUrl.clone()
  url.pathname = '/auth/login'
  return NextResponse.redirect(url)
}
```

Now:
- ✅ Root path `/` → Allow access (public landing page)
- ✅ `/auth/*` → Allow access (authentication pages)
- ❌ `/protected/*` or other authenticated routes → Redirect to login

## File Modified
- **File**: `lib/middleware.ts`
- **Lines**: 41-51
- **Change Type**: Logic update for route access control

## Testing Verification
After the fix:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3001 | grep "Magic UI is the new way"
```

Result: ✅ Hero section HTML is now returned successfully

The landing page is now fully accessible at http://localhost:3001 with all sections rendering:
1. ✅ Hero Section with AnimatedShinyText badge
2. ✅ Logo Cloud
3. ✅ SphereMask visual separator
4. ✅ Pricing Section with toggle
5. ✅ CTA Section with multi-layer marquee

## Recommendations for Future
Consider defining public routes in a configuration file for easier maintenance:

```typescript
// Example: lib/config/public-routes.ts
export const PUBLIC_ROUTES = [
  '/',
  '/auth',
  '/about',
  '/contact',
  '/pricing',
  // Add more marketing pages here
]
```

Then in middleware:
```typescript
import { PUBLIC_ROUTES } from '@/lib/config/public-routes'

const isPublicRoute = PUBLIC_ROUTES.some(route =>
  request.nextUrl.pathname === route ||
  request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith(`${route}/`)
)
```

This would make it easier to add new public pages without modifying the middleware logic each time.
